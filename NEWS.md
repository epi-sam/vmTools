# vmTools 0.3.0 (2024-10-15)

Several improvements for consistency and sensible defaults based on trial deployment.

## Logs

- Central log now gets all demotions (previously only promotions were recorded, but this can create confusion).
- Marked folders are no longer demoted and re-promoted if they are marked as the same folder type
   - Prevents log bloat.
   - Prevents confusion about when date-versions were elevated.

## Reports

- Main 'important versions' report has a sensible name.
- Report names are consolidated to private dictionaries.
- Reports are now sorted based on the `timestamp` field, which should keep all versions chronological based on when they were marked.

## Methods

- added `roundup_unmark()` method
   - Useful for finding folders that are not being tracked for easier bulk-removal.
- added `roundup_best()` method
   - Back-filling a conspicuously absent option - allows the tool to be used for systematic operations with the `best` version, instead of hand-building file paths.

## NEWS

- Added this file.



# vmTools 0.2.0

## Vignettes

Two written:

- one fully technical
- one scoped for new users



# vmTools 0.1.0

- Symlink tool is fully functional with basic tasks.
